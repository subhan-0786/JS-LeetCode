# JS-LeetCode
This repository documents my internship journey at AI NAECO Blue, where I am committed to solving 2â€“3 LeetCode problems daily in JavaScript. The goal is to sharpen my problem-solving skills, strengthen my JavaScript development expertise. Each solution is organized by problem and includes clear, well-documented code for reference and learning.
